# TF2 Colored Chat Trolling Tool

This is a web tool I made for generating **fake TF2 chat messages** using color codes and formatting.

You can use it to:

- Make people say stuff
- Fake achievements
- Fake item messages

I made this in one day, and I'm fairly new at coding so if you find anything wrong or have any suggestions open an issue or leave a comment on the repository.

Also sorry that this code is probably the worst code anyone has ever seen lol
